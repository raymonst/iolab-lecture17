Object-Oriented Javascript
==============

We looked at two different approaches of OOP: a) literal notation, and b) construction function. In this lab, you will use those two concepts to build a simple geometric shapes calculator. Your tasks are as follow: 
* Use object literal notation to build the calculator's functionalities (index-literal_notation.html & script-literal_notation.js)
* Use object construction function to build the calculator's functionalities (index-constructor_function.html & script-constructor_function.js) 
* They both should function the same on the front-end. The only difference is in the OOP approach you use in the script.
